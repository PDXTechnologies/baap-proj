PDX BaaP (Blockchain-as-a-Platform) disruptively reinnovates and reconstructs the blockchain for painless development, deployment, operation and cloudification of secure and privacy-protected, extremely scalable and available real world critical applications at minimized cost and with fastest time-to-market.

PDX BaaP sits atop and is agnostic to the underlining blockchain stacks with interoperability and federation support across same or different blockchain stacks. PDX BaaP supports Ethereum and Tendermint right now; support on HyperLedger is currently underway in line with the HyperLedger project progress. 

PDX BaaP supports truly private smart contracts (d-app) on public or consotium BaaP blockchains, helps realizing ultimate protection on business data, business logic as well as the whole operation environment.

PDX BaaP realizes HTTP/S RESTful-based smart contracts to run on-node in the BaaP container, on-node outside of the BaaP container, or totally remote. No restriction on functionality and technology preference and integration with existing ecosystem.
