PDX DaaP is an innovative blockchain-based decentralization platform for painless development, deployment, operation and cloudification of secure and privacy-protected, extremely scalable and available real world applications at minimized cost and with fastest time-to-market.

PDX DaaP realizes HTTP/S RESTful-based smart contracts (d-app) to run on node in DaaP container, on node outside of the DaaP container, if remotely. Truly no restriction smartest contracts on the blockchain now!

PDX DaaP runs atop Ethereum and Tendermint right now. Support on HyperLedger is currently underway in line with the HyperLedger project progress. 

Source code is to go online in the next couple of days. So please stay tuned and waiting for the @PDXTechnologies twitter announcement.
